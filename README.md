# portfolioWebsite

Here is all the code that comprises my website. I've left the images and documents out of this repo; you can see them on the website.

Check out the 'website_structure.png' image to see the website's directory structure. In that image, the bolded text represents a directory, and everything else represents a file. All the images and documents you can view or download from the website are stored in the 'imagesDocs' directory.

The website itself can be found at davwyr.com/portfolio 

Currently, it's only supported on desktop; the mobile version is coming soon!
