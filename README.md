# portfolioWebsite

Here is all the code that comprises my website. I've left the images and documents out of this repo; you can access them directly from the website.

Check out the 'website_structure.png' image to see the website's directory structure. In that image, the bolded text represents a directory, and everything else represents a file. All the images and documents that you can view or download from the website are stored in the 'images&docs' directory.

The website itself will be up on the web very soon, and I'll post the link here once it becomes available!
