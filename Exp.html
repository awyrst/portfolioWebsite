        <p class="text"> My work with the ISMART Lab
            so far has been on a project in developing AI for Healthcare. This project has called several times upon
            my understanding of signal processing, and has required me to become familiar with operating much of
            Biopac's hardware, equipment, and software. The project has also required me to assist in preparing
            technical
            documentation such as an application to McGill's Research Ethics Board and has also had me search through
            academic
            literature concerning non-invasive health monitoring and physiological signal recording. I
            would share more details if I could, but the specifics are confidential.<br> <br> Overall, I'm very thankful
            to Prof. Armanfard for the opportunity to work with
            the iSMART Lab, and I'm excited for what's to come! <br><br>

            institutions
            in Quebec and is among the highest ranked universities in the country. McGill's Department of Mathematics
            and

            of leading

            teaching assistant. This is an introductory course in linear algebra that teaches about vector spaces,
            matrices, linear transformations, projections onto lines and planes, diagonalization, and many other
            concepts and their applications. I held in-person office hours twice a week from 1pm to 4pm (often staying
            for longer), and I also joined the instructor for extra sessions before all midterm and final exams.

            I emphasized strengthening students' understanding to help them discover the answers to their own questions.
            Especially as you study math at a deeper level, it often becomes more important to understand why the answer
            is correct than to arrive at the answer itself. That's the kind of inquisitive spirit that I would instill
            in my students. This was my first formal experience in helping students, and I absolutely loved it!

        <p class="preamble">Located at 955 Lakeshore Boulevard in Toronto, Ontario, the provincial government
            redeveloped
            a section of Ontario Place's parking lots into a new waterfront park and trail known as Trillium Park in
            2016.
            With the opening of Trillium Park, the rest of the Ontario Place grounds remained as a public space for
            walking and biking, with several events scheduled to take place on-site especially during the Summer.
            Ontario
            Place also had two operational marinas for patrons to keep their boats, and the Cinesphere (the world's
            first IMAX theatre) remained open as well. This was the state of Ontario Place during my first work term.
            However, much of the park including the Cinesphere and marinas was closed during my second work term, with
            Trillium Park being the main source of pedestrian traffic.

                    In my first Summer at Ontario Place, I was part of the GEP (garbage, events and programming) team.
                    The
                    GEP
                    team was divided into two subgroups of 3 people; one which operated from Sunday to Wednesday and the
                    other which
                    operated from Wednesday to Saturday. I was in the former subgroup. We would work ten hour shifts
                    from
                    8:30am to 6:30pm, and both subgroups would work on Wednesdays. Our daily responsibilities were to
                    perform
                    tours of the park to change garbage bags, dispose of litter around the site, and to empty and clean
                    our rentable fire pits. Any garbage
                    we
                    collected
                    throughout the day would be taken to our local trash compactor, where we would compact it ourselves.
                    In addition to the daily tasks, our manager would
                    inform us about events that were scheduled to take place on site and give us assignments to help
                    prepare accordingly.
                    These extra assignments could be to clean a particular area of the site, to move assets such as
                    chairs or tables from
                    one location to another, or to help one of the other teams (other than GEP) with their tasks.
                    <span class="read-more-text">
                        <br> <br> In my second work term at Ontario Place, I had a more flexible position. I was working
                        8:30am to 4:30pm from Monday to Friday, and I operated between two teams. One team was tasked
                        with
                        tending to Trillium Park, and the other was tasked with cutting grass throughout the site. In
                        concept
                        I was there to help whichever team needed me most, but I actually spent significantly more time
                        with
                        the Trillium Park team. The main tasks were to redevelop overgrown sections of the park, remove
                        invasive plant species, and weed flower beds. Throughout my time at Ontario Place, I learned to
                        operate
                        the push-mower, weed wacker, backpack blower, roto-tiller and even our trash compactor! Although
                        I enjoyed
                        the leisure of being outside and getting a mental break in this Summer position, I decided after
                        my second Summer there that it was time to start taking greater steps in my career.
